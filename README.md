# Up and Running

There are two parts for this demo (both parts need to be up and running)

1) The Browser Extension
- cd into the `extension` project
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run start` for dev mode and `npm run build` for production build
- install the extension into your browser (I only tested with Chrome)

2) The demo website page for showing that the cookie has been fetched
- cd into the `site` project
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run start`
- navigate to `http://localhost:3000/static/index.html`
